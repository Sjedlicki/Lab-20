                Hi there, my name is Steve. I don't like blogging or social media. I don't even know how to blog.
            </p>

            <p>
                My journey to becoming a developer started back in October of 2018. I was playing Path of Exiles with friend
                and in the game we used a script that was created to filter and highlight valuable items within the game. I was suggesting
                to my friend that it would be nice if I could understand how this script is built, so that I might make my own edits
                to it. He told me that his roommate went to Grand Circus coding school and he absolutely loved it and recommended
                it to anyone interested in coding. Fast forward a few months, and here I am, creating this website while you reading this.

                I was born and raised in Rochester Hills, Michigan and have lived here my whole my life. At the age of 15.5 years my
                family and I moved to the other side of Rochester Hills. Even though it's called Oakland Township, it still in the Rochester
                mailing district.
